Data Structures: Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs, Hash Tables

Software Development Life Cycle includes requirements analysis, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance phases. Each phase has specific deliverables and quality checkpoints.

Object-Oriented Programming Concepts:
1. Encapsulation - bundling data and methods
2. Inheritance - creating new classes from existing ones
3. Polymorphism - same interface, different implementations
4. Abstraction - hiding implementation details

Database Management Systems store and retrieve data efficiently using SQL queries.
SELECT * FROM students WHERE grade > 85 AND department = 'Computer Science';
INSERT INTO courses VALUES ('CS101', 'Introduction to Programming', 3);
UPDATE students SET grade = 95 WHERE student_id = 12345;

Network Protocols: HTTP/HTTPS, TCP/IP, UDP, FTP, SSH, DNS, DHCP
Web Technologies: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript ES6+, React, Angular, Vue.js, Node.js

Algorithm Complexity Analysis:
- Time Complexity: O(1), O(log n), O(n), O(n log n), O(n^2), O(2^n)
- Space Complexity: auxiliary memory usage during execution

Machine Learning Applications in modern software systems include natural language processing, computer vision, recommendation systems, and predictive analytics for business intelligence.

Cybersecurity measures protect systems from unauthorized access, data breaches, malware attacks, and other security threats through encryption, authentication, and monitoring.

Mobile Development Platforms: Android (Java/Kotlin), iOS (Swift/Objective-C), Cross-platform (React Native, Flutter, Xamarin)

Cloud Computing Services: Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), Software as a Service (SaaS)
Major providers include Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

Version Control Systems like Git enable collaborative software development with branching, merging, and distributed repositories for code management.
